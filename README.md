## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/41122171-cc8f-46fc-92a4-10acbdedf638) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

### Local Development Setup

To work locally, you need Node.js and npm. It is strongly recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage your Node.js versions.

#### Quick Start

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

#### Task-Driven Workflow (Recommended)
This project uses a task-driven workflow with the `task-master` CLI to manage development tasks:

```sh
# See all tasks and their status
task-master list

# Show details for a specific task
task-master show <id>

# Mark a task as done
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done
```

See `.windsurfrules` for full workflow details and advanced commands.

You can also use the Lovable cloud editor or GitHub Codespaces for browser-based development.


**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
