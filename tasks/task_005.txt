# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Analytics Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create backend service for processing test results and calculating performance metrics
# Details:
Implement analytics service to process raw test data, establish baseline scores (from initial tests), calculate performance deltas against baseline, and perform basic statistical analysis. Create APIs for retrieving processed analytics data. Include logic to handle edge cases like insufficient baseline data or outlier results.

# Test Strategy:
Validate calculations with known test datasets. Verify baseline determination logic and delta calculations. Test statistical analysis functions with edge cases. Benchmark performance with large datasets.
