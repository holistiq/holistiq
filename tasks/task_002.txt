# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Database Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish core data models and relationships for users, test results, supplement intake, and analytics
# Details:
Design and implement database schemas for all required models: User Model (id, email, creation date, preferences), Test Results Model (user ID reference, test type, timestamp, raw scores, calculated metrics), Supplement Intake Model (user ID reference, supplement name, dosage, timestamp, notes), and Analytics Model (user ID reference, baseline references, calculated deltas). Set up proper indexing, relationships, and constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Validate database schema with sample data insertion. Test relationships between tables, query performance, and data integrity constraints. Ensure proper backup mechanisms are in place.
