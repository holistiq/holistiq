# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement N-back Working Memory Test
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core cognitive assessment test with proper timing and scoring mechanisms
# Details:
Create a browser-based n-back test with 2-back and 3-back levels, 3-minute duration, and visual-only stimuli. Implement using requestAnimationFrame API for precise timing. Include test instructions, environment preparation guidance, and results calculation. Develop algorithms for score calculation (accuracy percentage, reaction time) and validity checks. Ensure low-latency test delivery (<100ms) and reliable timing.

# Test Strategy:
Test timing accuracy across different browsers and devices. Validate scoring algorithms against expected outcomes. Measure and verify test-retest reliability. Test under various network conditions to ensure consistent performance.
