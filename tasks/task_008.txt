# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Test Experience Improvements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the cognitive test with calibration, improved instructions, and environment validity checks
# Details:
Implement device latency calibration routine to improve timing accuracy. Enhance test instructions with clearer guidance and environment preparation steps. Add validity checks to detect suboptimal testing conditions (window switching, tab changes, etc.). Implement fullscreen mode for test taking.

# Test Strategy:
Test calibration routine across different devices and browsers. Verify that validity checks correctly identify testing interruptions. Conduct user testing to validate clarity of instructions and preparation guidance.
