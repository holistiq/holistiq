## Authentication & Authorization

### Current Status
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled for all database tables
- ✅ Appropriate RLS policies are in place for user data isolation
- ✅ Session timeout and recovery mechanisms are implemented

### Recommended Enhancements

#### JWT Token Security
- [ ] Implement token rotation for long-lived sessions
- [ ] Verify token expiration settings (currently 30 minutes)
- [ ] Add refresh token validation and secure storage
- [ ] Implement JWT claims validation

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Add support for authenticator apps (TOTP)
- [ ] Implement recovery codes for MFA backup
- [ ] Make MFA optional but strongly encouraged for users
- [ ] Require MFA for sensitive operations (e.g., changing password, deleting account)

#### Session Management
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection
- [ ] Add login notification for new devices/locations
- [ ] Create a user-accessible session management dashboard
- [ ] Implement forced logout for all sessions when password is changed

## Data Protection

### Current Status
- ✅ Data is stored in Supabase with RLS policies
- ✅ Basic input validation is implemented

### Recommended Enhancements

#### Data Encryption
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest in Supabase
- [ ] Implement client-side encryption for highly sensitive data
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications (enforce with HSTS)
- [ ] Implement encrypted local storage for sensitive client-side data

#### Data Sanitization
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Implement output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Sanitize file uploads and implement strict file type validation
- [ ] Add content validation for user-generated content

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- [ ] Audit all database queries to ensure parameterized statements
- [ ] Avoid dynamic SQL construction
- [ ] Implement least privilege database access
- [ ] Regular security scanning of database queries

## API Security

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic authentication for API endpoints

### Recommended Enhancements

#### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Implement IP-based throttling for suspicious activity

#### API Authentication
- [ ] Ensure all API endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Implement API key rotation for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Add request signing for critical endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper scope-based authorization for API access

#### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Restrict CORS to only necessary domains
- [ ] Implement proper CORS headers
- [ ] Regularly audit and update CORS configuration
- [ ] Test CORS configuration with security tools

## Frontend Security

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic security measures in place

### Recommended Enhancements

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Implement a strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Restrict inline scripts and styles
- [ ] Configure report-uri for CSP violations
- [ ] Regularly review and update CSP rules

#### Secure Cookie Configuration
- [ ] Set HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags on cookies
- [ ] Implement proper cookie expiration
- [ ] Use cookie prefixes for additional security
- [ ] Regularly rotate cookie secrets

#### Local Storage Security
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] Encrypt any data that must be stored client-side
- [ ] Implement secure storage mechanisms (e.g., IndexedDB with encryption)
- [ ] Clear sensitive data when user logs out

## Infrastructure Security

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic environment variable usage

### Recommended Enhancements

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] Ensure all sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- [ ] Implement secret rotation
- [ ] Use a secrets management service for production
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration

#### Dependency Scanning
- [ ] Implement automated dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Set up automated security alerts for dependencies
- [ ] Implement a dependency update policy

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
- [ ] Use generic error messages for users while logging detailed errors server-side
- [ ] Set up centralized error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in React components

## Compliance & Privacy

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic privacy policy in place

### Recommended Enhancements

#### Privacy Policy
- [ ] Ensure privacy policy is up-to-date and compliant with regulations
- [ ] Implement proper data deletion mechanisms
- [ ] Add user data export functionality
- [ ] Regularly review and update privacy practices

#### Data Retention
- [ ] Define and implement data retention policies
- [ ] Add automated data purging for old records
- [ ] Implement data anonymization for analytics
- [ ] Create data classification guidelines

#### Audit Logging
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging for security events
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- [ ] Ensure logs are securely stored and tamper-proof
- [ ] Implement log rotation and retention policies

## Credential Management

### Best Practices for Credential Management

#### Local Development
- [ ] Use .env.local files that are gitignored
- [ ] Implement a secure method for sharing credentials among team members
- [ ] Use environment-specific configuration files
- [ ] Never hardcode credentials in application code

#### Version Control
- [ ] Ensure .env files are in .gitignore
- [ ] Use git-secrets or similar tools to prevent committing secrets
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
- [ ] Have a protocol for credential rotation if secrets are accidentally committed

#### Production Deployment
- [ ] Use platform-specific secrets management (Vercel/Netlify environment variables)
- [ ] Implement secret rotation policies
- [ ] Use a dedicated secrets management service for complex deployments
- [ ] Implement least-privilege access to production credentials
