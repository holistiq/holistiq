# Session Restored Dialog Fix - Verification Guide

## Issue Fixed
The "Session Restored" dialog was appearing inappropriately during normal sign-in processes instead of only during actual session recovery scenarios.

## Root Cause
The `SessionProvider` component was running session recovery logic during every authentication flow, including normal sign-ins. This caused the system to treat normal authentication as "session recovery" and potentially show inappropriate notifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Session Recovery Toast Function
- **File**: `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
- **Change**: Removed the `sessionRecoveryToast()` function that was defined but never used
- **Reason**: This function could potentially be called inappropriately and was not being used anywhere

### 2. Enhanced SessionProvider Logic
- **File**: `src/components/auth/SessionProvider.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added intelligent detection to distinguish between normal sign-in and actual session recovery needs
  - Added checks for OAuth callback flows, sign-in pages, and recent authentication
  - Implemented `holistiq_just_signed_in` flag to prevent inappropriate session recovery
  - Only performs session recovery when truly needed (page refresh, browser restart, etc.)

### 3. Added Authentication Flow Markers
- **Files**: 
  - `src/pages/auth/OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx`
  - `src/services/sessionManager.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Set `holistiq_just_signed_in` flag in sessionStorage during successful authentication
  - This flag prevents the SessionProvider from running session recovery logic immediately after sign-in

## How Session Recovery Now Works

### Normal Sign-In Flow (No Session Recovery)
1. User clicks "Sign In with Google"
2. OAuth flow completes successfully
3. `holistiq_just_signed_in` flag is set in sessionStorage
4. SessionProvider detects the flag and skips session recovery logic
5. **Result**: No inappropriate "Session Restored" dialog appears

### Actual Session Recovery Scenarios (Session Recovery Runs)
1. **Page Refresh**: User refreshes the page while authenticated
2. **Browser Restart**: User closes and reopens browser with valid session
3. **Direct URL Access**: User navigates directly to a protected page with valid session
4. **Tab Restoration**: Browser restores tabs after crash with valid session

### Conditions for Session Recovery
Session recovery only runs when ALL of these conditions are met:
- No user is currently authenticated (`!user`)
- Not in OAuth callback flow (`!isOAuthCallback`)
- Not on sign-in page (`!isSignInPage`)
- User didn't just complete sign-in (`!isJustSignedIn`)

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Should NOT Show Session Restored Dialog

#### Test 1: Normal Google Sign-In
1. Go to sign-in page
2. Click "Sign In with Google"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Expected**: Redirect to dashboard with no session restored dialog

#### Test 2: Direct Sign-In from Homepage
1. Go to homepage
2. Click "Sign In" button
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Expected**: Redirect to dashboard with no session restored dialog

#### Test 3: Sign-In After Sign-Out
1. Sign out from the application
2. Sign in again immediately
3. **Expected**: Normal sign-in flow with no session restored dialog

### ✅ Should Handle Session Recovery Silently

#### Test 4: Page Refresh While Authenticated
1. Sign in normally
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Expected**: Page loads normally, user remains authenticated, no dialog

#### Test 5: Browser Restart with Valid Session
1. Sign in with "Remember me" checked
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to dashboard
4. **Expected**: User is automatically authenticated, no dialog

#### Test 6: Direct URL Access
1. Sign in with "Remember me" checked
2. Open new tab and go directly to `/dashboard`
3. **Expected**: Dashboard loads with user authenticated, no dialog

### ✅ Should Show Appropriate Messages Only When Needed

#### Test 7: Session Timeout Warning
1. Sign in normally
2. Wait for session timeout warning (after 25 minutes of inactivity)
3. **Expected**: Session timeout warning dialog appears (this is correct behavior)

#### Test 8: Session Expired
1. Sign in normally
2. Wait for session to expire (after 30 minutes of inactivity)
3. **Expected**: Session expired modal appears (this is correct behavior)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session Recovery Detection Logic
```typescript
const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
const isOAuthCallback = currentPath.includes('/auth/callback');
const isSignInPage = currentPath === '/signin' || currentPath === '/login';
const isJustSignedIn = sessionStorage.getItem('holistiq_just_signed_in') === 'true';

if (!user && !isOAuthCallback && !isSignInPage && !isJustSignedIn) {
  // Only then perform session recovery
}
```

### Authentication Flow Markers
```typescript
// Set during successful authentication
sessionStorage.setItem('holistiq_just_signed_in', 'true');

// Cleared after SessionProvider processes it
sessionStorage.removeItem('holistiq_just_signed_in');
```

## Benefits of This Fix

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ No more confusing "Session Restored" dialogs during normal sign-in
- ✅ Cleaner authentication flow without unnecessary notifications
- ✅ Proper distinction between sign-in and session recovery

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ More intelligent session management logic
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns between authentication and recovery
- ✅ Better handling of different authentication scenarios

### Maintained Functionality
- ✅ Actual session recovery still works when needed
- ✅ Session timeout warnings and expiration handling unchanged
- ✅ Cross-tab synchronization still functions properly

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logs to Watch For
- **Normal Sign-In**: "Skipping session recovery - user just completed sign-in"
- **Actual Recovery**: "Found recoverable session for user: [email]"
- **No Recovery Needed**: No session recovery logs during normal authentication

### SessionStorage Flags
- `holistiq_just_signed_in`: Temporarily set during authentication, then cleared
- Should not persist between browser sessions

### Expected Behavior
- **After Normal Sign-In**: No session-related toast notifications
- **After Page Refresh**: Silent session restoration without notifications
- **After Browser Restart**: Silent session restoration without notifications

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the changes can be easily reverted by:
1. Restoring the original SessionProvider logic
2. Re-adding the sessionRecoveryToast function if needed
3. Removing the authentication flow markers

The fix is designed to be conservative and maintain all existing functionality while only preventing inappropriate notifications.
